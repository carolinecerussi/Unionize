## Research Materials/ sources:
-https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html - How to use react techniques to grab api information

--https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/how-to-make-api-calls-in-react-applications-7758052bf69 - help write set up api instructions for readme file and good source for api process using REACT

-https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts- learn how to fetch these posts into our React application, add new posts, and finally delete a specific post with Axios.


## API References :
*Google Map  places API - used for locating local union resources near specific area.  (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places)
*Telegram API for messaging - https://core.telegram.org/tdlib- encrypted messaging for custom direct messaging platform 

*Grocy - https://en.demo.grocy.info/api- Although used for grocery and task lists at home- The framework of the rotating user task is something Iâ€™m interested in adding to the functionality of the app.. And may be a good reference point. 


## Capstone Proposal Form
* Link to the proposal of my capstone final project can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ClR67swIQ-G5fZZhUtLExbdqhUTLgSYecsUZ7dusMdI/edit?usp=sharing


## Research & Project planning log 
#### Friday 09-16-22 :
* 8:00 - Started organizing my thoughts and working through the capstone proposal form 
*9:00 - After doing more research to better refine my idea, I began to prep what I'd like my MVP outline to look like
*11:00 - After  reading API sources and better planning out functionality - start to do more reading to figure out which  language would be best utilized 
*3:00-  Finish proposal sheet and continue research and videos on react using Axios for grabbing APIs 


### Making API calls with REACT using Fetch and Axios
You need to have NodeJS installed on your local desktop and know-how HTTP works. If you want to practice and run this on your computer, you need to have these downloaded: 

* NodeJS
* Create React App
* VSCode
